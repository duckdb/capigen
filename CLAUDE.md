This document is the authoritative guide for DuckDB C API v2 spec definitions
(`api_spec/v2/*/*.yaml`).

The goal is:
- deterministic, scriptable transformation
- maintain API compatibility semantics
- enforce new versioned conventions and types
- make it straightforward for another LLM to perform the migration automatically

## Project structure

```
api_spec/                      # API spec (YAML) — will move to duckdb core
  metadata.yaml           # suffixes, primitives (with c_type), versions, schema_version
  v2/                     # module YAML files
src/capigen/
  schema/                 # IDL schema (JSON Schema) — versioned with capigen
  __main__.py             # CLI: uv run capigen c -o duckdb_v2.h
  loader.py               # YAML loading + JSON Schema validation
  validate.py             # cross-module referential integrity checks
  adapters/c/
    resolve.py            # spec → C type resolution (includes primitive mapping)
    render.py             # C render dataclasses (template contract)
    templates/            # Jinja2 templates
tests/                    # pytest suite
```

The spec (`api_spec/`) and capigen (`src/capigen/`) are versioned independently.
`metadata.yaml` declares a `schema_version` that bridges the two.

## Module constructs

Each module YAML file can contain these top-level sections:

| Construct | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `handles` | Opaque handle types (always `_ptr` in C) |
| `callbacks` | Callback function pointer typedefs (always `_cb` in C) |
| `aliases` | Named type aliases (always `_t` in C) |
| `structs` | Structs with consumer-visible fields |
| `enums` | Enumerations with auto-numbered values |
| `constants` | Named compile-time values |
| `error_groups` | Hierarchical error codes: `(group_id << 16) | code` |
| `functions` | API function declarations |

## Core rules

1. Every function must return an error code as the first-level return type.
   - legacy `duckdb_state`, `duckdb_error` map to `DUCKDB_V2_API_CALL` in v2.

2. **Every fallible function takes a `duckdb_v2_error_info *err` as its LAST parameter** (with `kind: OUT`, `indirection: 1`, i.e. a pointer-to-handle out-parameter). Destructors are the exception — they are infallible and take no `err` (see rule 2a).
   - `duckdb_v2_error_info` is an opaque handle declared in `api_spec/v2/common/common.yaml`. On failure the library allocates an info and writes its pointer into `*err`; the caller owns it.
   - Contract: the return value always carries the error code and is authoritative — never infer success or failure from the state of `*err`. `err` is optional — callers may pass `nullptr` to opt out of detail. On failure, if `err != nullptr`, the library writes an info into the slot (lazy-allocating on the slot's first use, overwriting in place thereafter) and the caller destroys it with `duckdb_v2_error_info_destroy`. On success the library leaves the slot untouched — it does not allocate, clear, or null it, so a stale info from an earlier failure may survive a later successful call. Read `*err` only after a failing return; there is no "clear" step and no clear function.
   - Canonical `err` parameter description in YAML: `"Optional. On failure, receives an opaque info handle the caller must destroy via duckdb_v2_error_info_destroy."`
   - Implementations must tolerate `err == nullptr` on every path — use the `SetErrorInfo` helper in `capi_v2_internal.hpp` (failure path only; guards on null, lazy-allocates or overwrites in place, never destroys). Most entry points don't call it directly: they wrap their body in the `WithErrorHandler` template, which catches and writes the slot only on failure.
   - There is no longer a context handle. The first parameter is the primary subject of the call (the object being operated on) if any; otherwise skip straight to the arguments.

2a. **Destructors (`role: destructor`) are infallible and take no `err` parameter** — only their handle slot. They still return `DUCKDB_V2_API_CALL_t`, are null-safe (a null slot or already-null handle is a no-op), and null the slot on return to prevent double-free. The canonical shape is `duckdb_v2_scalar_function_builder_destroy(duckdb_v2_scalar_function_builder_ptr *func)`. A destructor that can genuinely refuse (e.g. `duckdb_v2_destroy_environment` → `RESOURCE_IN_USE` while databases are open) reports that through the return code alone — without an `err` slot there is no message detail.

3. For functions that need to return data, use an `out` pointer parameter before the trailing `err` parameter.
   - Example: `duckdb_logical_type *out_type` becomes `out_type` typed pointer with `kind: OUT`.
   - Canonical order: primary subject → inputs → `out_*` → `err`.

4. Type naming conventions (determined by construct type, not a `kind` field):
   - `handles` → suffix `_ptr`
   - `callbacks` → suffix `_cb`
   - `aliases` → suffix `_t`
   - keep old function names exactly (backward compatibility) unless renamed by policy.

5. Parameter conventions:
   - pointer argument: `type: char`, `indirection: 1`, for input strings.
   - `kind` declares both direction and ownership. One of: `IN` (default; input, caller keeps ownership), `IN_TRANSFER` (input, callee takes ownership), `OUT` (output, caller must free/destroy), `OUT_BORROW` (output, callee retains; caller views). `OUT` / `OUT_BORROW` require `indirection >= 1`. See `schema_reference.md` for the full matrix.

## Module conversion mapping

### Typical module name handling
- `appender` group → `api_spec/v2/appender/appender.yaml`
- `scalar` group → `api_spec/v2/scalar/scalar.yaml`
- `common`/shared types → `api_spec/v2/common/common.yaml`

## New v2 form details

### handles
- declare shared opaque handles in `common/common.yaml` once.
- avoid duplicates: if a handle exists in common, do not redeclare in other modules.
- module-specific handles go in the module file.

### aliases
- use for named type aliases: `error_code: {underlying: u32}` → `duckdb_v2_error_code_t`
- can alias primitives or other declared types.
- set `qualified: true` to emit the alias verbatim — see "Qualified aliases" below.

### functions
- Each legacy function becomes a `functions` entry.
- Maintain `role` from behavior:
  - `constructor` for `create` family
  - `destructor` for `destroy`
  - `getter` for `column_count`, `column_type`, `error_data`, etc.
  - `setter/method` for mutating operations
- Do not port deprecated APIs; create only active API surface in v2.

### Return value cross-assignments
- Prefer `DUCKDB_API_CALL` return with `out` parameters for values:
  - `duckdb_appender_column_count`: provide `out_column_count` as `idx` with `kind: OUT`
  - `duckdb_appender_column_type`: provide `out_column_type` as `duckdb_logical_type` with `kind: OUT`

### error_groups
- Error codes are 32-bit integers: `(group_id << 16) | code`
- `group_id` is the upper 16 bits (error category)
- `code` is the lower 16 bits (error within category)

### primitives in metadata.yaml
Primitives define the type vocabulary with their C ABI names (`c_type`).
Ensure there are entries for: opaque (void), bool, char, i8-i64, u8-u64, f32/f64, idx (idx_t)

### common handles in common/common.yaml
- `connection`, `data_chunk`, `vector`, `logical_type`, `value` (declared unprefixed; the prefix is applied at generation time — see "Prefix application" below).

> Errors are reported via the `duckdb_v2_error_info` opaque handle passed as the trailing `err` parameter to every fallible function — a pointer-to-handle "slot" (`error_info_ptr *err`). It is library-allocated on failure and destroyed by the caller via `duckdb_v2_error_info_destroy`; its code and message are read through `duckdb_v2_error_info_get_code` / `_get_text` and set (in callbacks) via `duckdb_v2_error_info_set_code` / `_set_text`. It is NOT a caller-stack-allocated plain struct.

## Spec-language reference

This section documents schema features that go beyond bare type declarations.
Each is opt-in; defaults preserve the simplest possible output.

### Descriptions

`description:` is accepted on `handles`, `aliases`, `structs`, `callbacks`,
`enums`, `enum values`, `constants`, `error_groups`, `error entries`, and
`function`/`parameter` definitions. On `handles`, `aliases`, and `structs`,
the C adapter renders the description as `//!`-prefixed Doxygen lines
immediately above the generated `typedef`. Multi-line descriptions (YAML
block scalars with `|`) become one `//!` line per non-empty input line —
leading and trailing whitespace on each line is stripped.

YAML:

```yaml
handles:
  connection:
    description: An opaque handle to a DuckDB connection
  environment:
    description: |
      An opaque handle to the V2 environment: the required root through
      which databases are opened.
```

Generated C output (with `prefix: "duckdb_v2_"`):

```c
//! An opaque handle to a DuckDB connection
typedef void *duckdb_v2_connection_ptr;

//! An opaque handle to the V2 environment: the required root through
//! which databases are opened.
typedef void *duckdb_v2_environment_ptr;
```

The same `//!`-line treatment applies to structs (above the `typedef
struct { ... }`) and aliases (above the alias `typedef`). The filter that
emits the lines is `_c_line_comment`, registered in
`capigen/src/capigen/adapters/c/__init__.py`. Templates that consume it:
`_c_fragments/_type.j2`, `_c_fragments/_struct.j2`.

Caveat: an empty `description:` (or one containing only whitespace) emits
nothing — no leading `//!` blank line. Keep description text self-contained;
it is the only user-facing documentation surface for the type.

### Prefix application

`metadata.yaml` declares a top-level `prefix:` string that is prepended to
every generated C identifier. Module YAML files MUST NOT bake the prefix
into type or function names — declare them bare and let the generator
apply the prefix.

YAML (`api_spec/v2/metadata.yaml`):

```yaml
prefix: "duckdb_v2_"
```

YAML (a module):

```yaml
handles:
  connection: {}     # → duckdb_v2_connection_ptr
aliases:
  error_code: { underlying: u32 }   # → duckdb_v2_error_code_t
  API_CALL:    { underlying: error_code }  # → DUCKDB_V2_API_CALL_t
enums:
  ERROR_KIND: {}     # → DUCKDB_V2_ERROR_KIND
constants:
  API_ERROR: { value: "0xFFFFFFFF" }  # → DUCKDB_V2_API_ERROR
functions:
  open: { ... }      # → duckdb_v2_open
```

Casing rules (`_apply_prefix` in `capigen/src/capigen/adapters/c/resolve.py`):

- For `handles`, `callbacks`, `aliases`, `structs`, the prefix is applied
  literally if the declared name starts with a lowercase letter, and
  uppercased if the declared name starts with an uppercase letter. This
  keeps `connection` → `duckdb_v2_connection_ptr` while `API_CALL` →
  `DUCKDB_V2_API_CALL_t` reads as a single SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier.
- For `enums`, `constants`, `error_groups`, enum members, and error entry
  names, the prefix is ALWAYS uppercased — these are member/macro names
  by convention even when the spec writer used lowercase characters in
  the bare name.

Setting `prefix: ""` (or omitting it) disables prefixing entirely; the
declared names become the canonical C names verbatim.

### Handle styles (`void_ptr` vs `tagged_struct`)

By default, a handle generates as an opaque `void *` typedef:

```c
typedef void *duckdb_v2_connection_ptr;
```

For handles where you want stronger type discipline at the C level (the
compiler refuses to silently convert between unrelated handle pointers),
opt into the `tagged_struct` style. It generates a one-field forward-
declared struct whose canonical name is a pointer-to-that-struct:

```c
typedef struct _duckdb_v2_connection {
    void *internal_ptr;
} *duckdb_v2_connection_ptr;
```

The `internal_ptr` field is what the bridge stores into; from the
consumer's perspective the handle is still passed around as an opaque
pointer, but `duckdb_v2_connection_ptr` and `duckdb_v2_database_ptr` are
now distinct compiler-level types.

Configuration lives in `metadata.yaml` under the C-adapter namespace:

```yaml
options:
  c:
    handles:
      default_style: tagged_struct     # one of: void_ptr (default), tagged_struct
      override_style:                  # optional per-handle opt-out/opt-in
        error_info: void_ptr           # this handle stays a plain void* typedef
```

`default_style` sets the style for every handle. `override_style` is a
map from bare handle name (the YAML key, not the canonical C name) to an
alternative style. Only `void_ptr` is honoured as an override value; any
other value silently inherits `default_style`.

The schema currently validates only the top-level shape of `options:`
(free-form object); typos under `options.c.handles.*` will not be caught
by JSON Schema validation. Verify by inspecting the generated header.

Caveat: changing a handle's style is an ABI break — the typedef name is
the same but the underlying type identity is not. Decide per-handle at
introduction time.

### Qualified aliases

By default, an alias `foo: { underlying: u32 }` generates
`typedef <underlying> duckdb_v2_foo_t;` (prefix prepended, alias suffix
appended). Set `qualified: true` to skip both: the YAML key becomes the
C name verbatim.

YAML:

```yaml
aliases:
  idx_t:
    underlying: u64
    qualified: true
```

Generated C:

```c
typedef uint64_t idx_t;
```

Use this when the alias name is already defined in another header or
external library and you want capigen to mirror it without renaming.
Common cases: `idx_t`, `sel_t`, `size_t`-like primitives that DuckDB core
exports under a fixed name.

Caveats:
- A qualified alias must still declare its `underlying` type. The
  `qualified` flag only affects the C name on the left-hand side of the
  generated `typedef` — not the right-hand side.
- The qualified alias is registered in the cross-module type registry
  under its verbatim name. Other modules referencing it must use the
  same verbatim name as the `type:` or `underlying:` value.
- Because the YAML key is treated as a C identifier, it must match the
  schema's identifier regex (`^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`) — letters,
  digits, and underscores; no leading digit.

## Validation/sanity pipeline

1. add/ensure primitives in `api_spec/metadata.yaml`.
2. add shared handles in `api_spec/v2/common/common.yaml`.
3. add module YAML under `api_spec/v2/<group>/<module>.yaml`.
4. run generator:
   - `uv run capigen c --spec-dir api_spec/v2 -o duckdb_v2.h`
5. handle errors:
   - JSON Schema validation errors → invalid field or value in YAML
   - `Type name 'X' is duplicated` → remove duplicate type declarations
   - `unknown type 'X'` → add to common or correct existing declarations.
6. run tests:
   - `uv run --group dev pytest capigen/tests`

## Helpful naming rubric

- appender handle → `duckdb_appender` (in `handles`, renders as `duckdb_appender_ptr`)
- scalar handles → `duckdb_ctx`, `duckdb_data_chunk`, etc.
- all string data: `type: char`, `indirection: 1`.

## Extra LLM guidance

- avoid baseless renaming unless requested by status or policy.
- preserve previous semantics and extant API surface.
- YAML modules are validated against `src/capigen/schema/module.schema.json`.
- only include fields supported by schema: `module`, `handles`, `callbacks`, `aliases`, `structs`, `enums`, `constants`, `error_groups`, `functions`.

## API lexical style guide

- `Connection` → `conn`
- `Callback` → `cb`
- `Statement` → `stmt`
- `Execution` → `exec`
- `Error` → `error`, `error_data`...
- `Destroy` → `destroy`
- `Begin/End` → `begin_...`, `end_...` as in `appender_begin_row`, `appender_end_row`
